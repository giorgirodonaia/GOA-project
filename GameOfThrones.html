                    "Game of Thrones" is a groundbreaking television series that aired on HBO from April 17,
                    2011, to May 19, 2019. Based on George R.R. Martin's series "A Song of Ice and Fire,"
                    the show was developed by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. It quickly gained immense popularity
                    for its complex characters, intricate plots, and willingness to subvert traditional fantasy tropes.
                    The series began with modest expectations but rapidly grew into a cultural phenomenon,
                    attracting a dedicated fanbase and critical acclaim. Over its eight seasons, "Game of Thrones" 
                    received numerous awards, including 59 Primetime Emmy Awards, making it one of the most awarded series in Emmy history.
                    Despite its early success, the final seasons received mixed reviews, particularly the last season,
                    which sparked significant debate among fans regarding character arcs and plot resolutions.
                    Despite this, "Game of Thrones" left an indelible mark on television history, influencing the fantasy genre and popular culture at large.
                    Following the series finale, HBO expanded the franchise with various spin-off projects, 
                    including "House of the Dragon," ensuring that the legacy of Westeros continues to thrive
                    in new narratives. The series remains a landmark achievement in modern television, 
                    celebrated for its ambitious storytelling and cinematic quality.

                <h3 >The story in each season:</h3>
                <div>
                <p>Season 1:<br>
                Like the novel, the season initially focuses on the family of nobleman Eddard "Ned" Stark, the Warden of the North, who is asked to become the King's Hand (chief advisor) to his longtime friend, King Robert Baratheon. Ned seeks to find out who murdered his predecessor, Jon Arryn.</p>
                <p>Season 2:<br>
                Against Cersei's wishes, Tyrion sends her and Jaime's daughter, Myrcella, to Dorne for protection. Theon captures Winterfell and executes Ser Rodrik Cassel. Osha, the captive Wildling, along with Hodor, helps Bran and Rickon escape. In the aftermath of another battle, Robb reunites with Talisa.</p>
                <p>Season 3:<br>
                Like the novel, the season continues the storyline of The War of the Five Kings: after the death of Renly Baratheon, all four kings in Westeros believe they have a claim to the Iron Throne, besides Robb Stark, who seeks vengeance for the death of his father, Ned Stark, and independence for the North.</p>
                <p>Season 4:<br>
                After the death of Robb Stark at The Red Wedding, all three remaining kings in Westeros believe they have a claim to the Iron Throne. King Joffrey is killed by poison at his wedding, and his uncle Tyrion is blamed; young Tommen Baratheon is crowned king. Meanwhile, Sansa Stark escapes King's Landing.</p>
                <p>Season 5:<br>
                Littlefinger has left Sansa Stark at Winterfell; she marries Ramsay Bolton, who rapes and imprisons her. Stannis is defeated and killed, while Sansa makes an escape with Theon. After Jon loses Night's Watchmen trying to rescue thousands of Wildlings from the White Walkers, several of his men mutiny and kill him.</p>
                <p>Season 6:<br>
                The season follows the continuing struggle among the noble families of Westeros for the Iron Throne. The Starks and allies defeat the Bolton forces in the "Battle of the Bastards" reuniting Sansa Stark and Jon Snow, who is proclaimed the King in the North, while Ramsay Bolton is killed.</p>
                <p>Season 7:<br>
                Cersei Lannister is now Queen of the Seven Kingdoms after eliminating her enemies in the capital. Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands, has been murdered. Euron Greyjoy, Balon's younger brother and killer, takes the Salt Throne and is crowned the new King of the Iron Islands.</p>
                <p>Season 8(unfinished):<br>
                The final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. In the first half of the season, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and many of the main characters converge at Winterfell to face the Dead.</p>

                        Season 2:96%:<u>willa paskin</u> said:"It contains all the necessary, hugely entertaining genre staples...but also the emotional and physical realism... that characterize TV's other best shows."<br>
                        Season 3:96%:<u>William thoman</u> said:"Every time Game Of Thrones threatens to become a 'guilty pleasure', it pulls off something awesome."<br>
                        Season 4:97%:<u>Katie Walsh</u> said:"Overall, it's been a dramatic, but uneven season, and who knows where they can go from here, having upped all the antes that could have possibly been upped."<br>
                        Season 5:93%:<u>Sarah Larson</u> said:"The episode ends with a decision that makes you want to cheer."

                        Season 8(unfinished):55%:<u>Chris Stuckman</u> said:"[This season] made choices that I just didn't understand...you have to wrap it up somehow, and this season is just full of more extremes and it just doesn't work anymore or fit in with the rest..."</p>
