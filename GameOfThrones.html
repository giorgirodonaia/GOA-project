                    "Game of Thrones" is a groundbreaking television series that aired on HBO from April 17,
                    2011, to May 19, 2019. Based on George R.R. Martin's series "A Song of Ice and Fire,"
                    the show was developed by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. It quickly gained immense popularity
                    for its complex characters, intricate plots, and willingness to subvert traditional fantasy tropes.

                    Despite its early success, the final seasons received mixed reviews, particularly the last season,
                    which sparked significant debate among fans regarding character arcs and plot resolutions.
                    Despite this, "Game of Thrones" left an indelible mark on television history, influencing the fantasy genre and popular culture at large.
                    Following the series finale, HBO expanded the franchise with various spin-off projects,
