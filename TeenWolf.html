            <p>Teen Wolf is an American supernatural teen drama television series developed by Jeff Davis for MTV. Serving as a supernatural reimagining of the 1985 film of the same name, the series is the fourth installment overall in the titular franchise. Tyler Posey portrays a young werewolf who defends his California town from supernatural creatures and other threats.
                The series premiered on June 5, 2011, and concluded on September 24, 2017, after six seasons. It received generally positive reviews from critics and won three Saturn Awards for Best Youth-Oriented Television Series. The series also received thirteen Teen Choice Awards, nine for the performances of Posey, Dylan O'Brien, Tyler Hoechlin, Holland Roden, and Shelley Hennig, and four for Choice Summer TV Series.</p>

            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Teen Wolf revolves around Scott McCall, a high school student living in the fictional California town of Beacon Hills. Scott becomes the eponymous teenage werewolf of the series after he is bitten by an alpha werewolf the night before his second year of high school, drastically changing his once-ordinary life. The bite forces him to balance his new identity with day-to-day teenage life and eventually help protect his hometown, which he learns is a beacon for supernatural activity.
                Scott begins the series as a relatively unpopular and unathletic student who lives with his divorced mother Melissa, a nurse at Beacon Hills Memorial Hospital. As a werewolf, he develops heightened physical abilities and senses well beyond those of an ordinary human, but he also must control animalistic instincts that are amplified by feelings of aggression and full moons. Further complicating matters, Scott develops romantic feelings for new classmate Allison Argent, who comes from a family of werewolf hunters that includes her father Chris Argent. Helping Scott manage his new life are his best friend Stiles Stilinski, the son of Beacon Hills Sheriff Stilinski, and the natural-born werewolf Derek Hale. The supernatural events surrounding Beacon Hills also end up affecting Lydia Martin, a popular and intelligent student who discovers that she is a banshee, and Jackson Whittemore, the captain of the school's lacrosse team who resents Scott's newfound attention. As new and familiar threats emerge, Scott is joined by werecoyote Malia Tate, kitsune Kira Yukimura, and Scott's first beta werewolf Liam Dunbar in keeping his family, friends, and the rest of the town safe.</p>
            
            <h2>Cast and characters</h2>
            <p>Tyler Posey as Scott McCall: Scott is turned into a werewolf in the series premiere and, alongside his friend Stiles, begins to uncover the complicated supernatural world of Beacon Hills, California.
                Crystal Reed (seasons 1-3; guest season 5) as Allison Argent: Scott's first love interest, Allison, descends from a long line of werewolf hunters. Her formidable prowess with a bow and arrow is an asset to the team in encounters with the shapeshifters and monsters that roam Beacon Hills. Reed also portrays Allison's ancestor Marie-Jeanne Valet in the fifth season.
                Dylan O'Brien as Stiles Stilinski: Stiles is Scott's childhood best friend, with a talent for solving mysteries and a fierce loyalty to those closest to him. As a young child, Stiles is portrayed by Anthony Lapenna. O'Brien also portrays the Nogitsune, a demon who possesses Stiles.
                Tyler Hoechlin (seasons 1-4; guest season 6) as Derek Hale: An older werewolf from a prominent werewolf family in Beacon Hills, Derek starts off with a hostile relationship towards Scott and his "pack" of friends, but comes to be a valuable ally. Ian Nelson portrays the teenage Derek.
                Holland Roden as Lydia Martin: A popular girl at Beacon Hills High and a close friend of Allison's. Lydia initially tries to play down her formidable intelligence, but she is a genius. After an encounter with Derek's villainous uncle Peter Hale in season one, her own supernatural abilities-those of a banshee-begin to manifest.
                Colton Haynes (seasons 1-2; guest season 6) as Jackson Whittemore: Lydia's shallow boyfriend. Jackson antagonises Scott and Stiles relentlessly but suffers from inner self-hatred. This causes his encounter with a werewolf's bite to turn him into another sort of creature: the deadly reptilian kanima. Jackson abruptly leaves Beacon Hills in the gap between seasons two and three, but returns for a guest stint at the end of season six, having come out and entered a relationship with another werewolf, Ethan.
                Shelley Hennig (seasons 4-6; recurring season 3) as Malia Tate: The daughter of Peter Hale and a werecoyote assassin, Malia was adopted into a local Beacon Hills family for her own safety. After her new family is killed, she spends her formative years as a fully transformed feral coyote. After rejoining the human social world, she develops a blunt, no-nonsense personality, while adjusting to teenage life as a fish out of water.
                Arden Cho (seasons 4-5; recurring season 3) as Kira Yukimura:[1] Kira moves to Beacon Hills as monsters from Japanese mythology are beginning to plague the lives of her new classmates; she herself discovers that she is a thunder kitsune with profound swordsmanship skills and electrical powers. Cho also portrays Kira's mother Noshiko as a young woman.
                Dylan Sprayberry (seasons 5-6; recurring season 4) as Liam Dunbar: Liam is a younger rival of Scott's with anger issues who Scott is forced to transform into a werewolf in order to save his life. Liam's anger gives him an uncommon degree of strength for a young werewolf, and he comes to develop a real respect for his mentor, Scott.
                Linden Ashby (season 6; recurring seasons 1-5) as Sheriff Noah Stilinski:[2] Noah is initially reluctant to help his son and Scott with their escapades but is later brought into their supernatural secret.
