        <h2 style="border:dotted;border-color:red;text-align:center;font-size:50px"><u>Pre-1890s</u></h2>
        <p style="border:dotted;border-color:red;font-size:30px">The origins of movies and cinematography can be traced back to the invention of the camera and the exploration of optical illusions. Early devices such as the magic lantern (a simple image projector) and the zoetrope (a rotating cylinder with slits that created the illusion of motion) were significant in developing the concept of motion pictures.</p>
        
        <h2 style="border:dotted;border-color:red;text-align:center;font-size:50px"><u>1890s</u></h2>
        <p style="border:dotted;border-color:red;font-size:30px">The invention of the Kinetoscope by Thomas Edison and William Kennedy Laurie Dickson in 1891 allowed for the viewing of moving pictures. The Lumière brothers, Auguste and Louis, further advanced the field by inventing the Cinématographe in 1895, which allowed for both filming and projecting motion pictures. Their first public screening on December 28, 1895, in Paris is often regarded as the birth of cinema.</p>
        
        <h2 style="border:dotted;border-color:red;text-align:center;font-size:50px"><u>The Silent film era(1900-1920s)</u></h2>
        <p style="border:dotted;border-color:red;font-size:30px">The silent film era saw rapid technological and artistic advancements. Key developments included the introduction of narrative storytelling, editing techniques, and the establishment of film studios. Iconic films from this era include D.W. Griffith’s "The Birth of a Nation" (1915) and "Intolerance" (1916). Stars like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Mary Pickford became international celebrities.</p>
        
        <h2 style="border:dotted;border-color:red;text-align:center;font-size:50px"><u>Movies have sound now(1927-1930s)</u></h2>
        <p style="border:dotted;border-color:red;font-size:30px">The introduction of synchronized sound revolutionized cinema. "The Jazz Singer" (1927), directed by Alan Crosland, is often credited as the first feature-length film with synchronized dialogue, marking the beginning of the "talkies" era. This transition brought new challenges and opportunities, leading to advancements in sound technology and changes in acting styles. The 1930s saw the rise of musicals and screwball comedies.</p>
        
        <h2 style="border:dotted;border-color:red;text-align:center;font-size:50px"><u>The Golden Age Of Hollywood(1930-1950s)</u></h2>
        <p style="border:dotted;border-color:red;font-size:30px">This period, often referred to as the Golden Age of Hollywood, was characterized by the dominance of major studios like MGM, Paramount, Warner Bros., and 20th Century Fox. The studio system produced a plethora of iconic films and stars. Genre films such as westerns, film noir, and musicals thrived. Notable films from this era include "Gone with the Wind" (1939), "Casablanca" (1942), and "Singin' in the Rain" (1952).</p>
        
        <h2 style="border:dotted;border-color:red;text-align:center;font-size:50px"><u>Post-War and Modern Cinema(1950-1960s)</u></h2>
        <p style="border:dotted;border-color:red;font-size:30px">The post-war era brought significant changes to the film industry. The rise of television posed a new challenge, leading to innovations such as widescreen formats (Cinemascope) and 3D films to lure audiences back to theaters. This period also saw the emergence of international cinema, with influential films from Japan, Italy, France, and other countries.</p>

(1982) and the continuation of successful franchises like "Indiana Jones".</p>
        
        <h2 style="border:dotted;border-color:red;text-align:center;font-size:50px"><u>The Digital Age(1990-2000s)</u><h2>
        <p style="border:dotted;border-color:red;font-size:30px">The advent of digital technology transformed filmmaking and distribution. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) revolutionized special effects, as seen in films like "Jurassic Park" (1993) and "The Matrix" (1999). The rise of the internet and digital distribution platforms began to change how audiences consumed films.</p>
